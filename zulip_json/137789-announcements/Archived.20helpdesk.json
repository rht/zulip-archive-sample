I've now implemented what has been discussed there and set up a new stream <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"274208\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/274208-helpdesk-.28archived.29\">#helpdesk (archived)</a> which is publicly archived on <a href=\"https://juliacommunity.github.io/zulip-archive/\">https://juliacommunity.github.io/zulip-archive/</a> (for now, nicer domain will follow).</p>\n<p>This does <strong>not</strong> affect <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"225542\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/225542-helpdesk\">#helpdesk</a> in any way.</p>\n<p>If you have a question that others may benefit from, consider posting it in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"274208\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/274208-helpdesk-.28archived.29\">#helpdesk (archived)</a> from now on :)</p>",
