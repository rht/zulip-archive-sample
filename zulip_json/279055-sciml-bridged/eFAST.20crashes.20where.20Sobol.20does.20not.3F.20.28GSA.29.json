I have it working fine for Sobol, but get the following error when I simply switch out the Sobol() to eFAST() in the gsa() call. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>JULIA: ArgumentError: Uniform: the condition a &lt; b is not satisfied.\n@ Distributions ~/.julia/packages/Distributions/7iOJp/src/univariate/continuous/uniform.jl:38\n@ GlobalSensitivity ~/.julia/packages/GlobalSensitivity/jG1Zc/src/eFAST_sensitivity.jl:98\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Any first glance ideas what this means? My project is using PyCall to have python call Julia, so debugging the Julia end is a pain... One thing I will not is that because my ODE often returns near 0 values (on the order of 1e-300), I multiply all its outputs by 1e200. Though this shouldn't make a difference to these methods if my understanding of them is correct. I will also note that from time to time, the samplers find a combination of parameters it doesn't like and aborts a run, this happens once every 4000 simulations with Sobol2007 estimator, roughly.</p>",
